This app will predict your chance of dying from COVID-19 (once contracted). I was inspired by several books, TV series, and more about the power of AI. I wanted to make an AI powered application that could be used to improve society. I decided upon using python, tensorflow and flask to make a web app, that would calculate your risk of death from COVID-19, which could then be used to **bring society back to normal after the pandemic, with minimal risk**.

Obviously, this isn't very accurate, but it shows the power of AI, and one of the (many) ways AI can help in the battle against COVID-19.

The reason why this particular AI isn't very accurate is that I didn't have much time to find the optimum number of epochs, or to find a large enough dataset with enough parameters. I spent most of the time looking for good data, which was probably one of the main hurdles I had to overcome!

The socio-economic issue this project takes a stab at is of course COVID-19, or more accurately, how society will go "back to normal" after it, and **stop a second wave while also allowing the economy to recover**. By using a similar app that uses AI, we can predict if an individual is going to contract it, and if they do, whether they will die from it.

We can then allow individuals with less risk to go back to their normal routine, which will then result in the virus dying out quicker, with minimal loss of life and economic loss.

Thanks for checking out my project!
