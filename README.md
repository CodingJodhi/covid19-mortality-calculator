# covid19-mortality-calculator
Calculates your death chance from COVID-19 using a small amount of information.

Obviously, this isn't very accurate, but it shows the power of AI, and one of the (many) ways AI can help in the battle against COVID-19.

The reason why this particular AI isn't very accurate is that I didn't have much time to find the optimum no. of epochs, or to find a large enough dataset, 
or even a similar sized dataset with more parameters. There just wasn't much good quality patient level data available. 

The socio-economic issue this project takes a stab at is of course COVID-19, or more accurately, how society will go "back to normal" after it, and stop a second wave.
By using a similar app that uses AI, we can predict if an idividual is going to contract it, and if they do, whether they will die from it.

We can then allow individuals with less risk (up to them of course) to go back to their normal routine, which will then result in the virus dying out, with minimal loss of life/economic loss.

Thanks for checking out my project!
